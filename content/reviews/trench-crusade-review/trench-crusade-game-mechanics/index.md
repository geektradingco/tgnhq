## Core Rules and Objectives 
**Objective**: The primary objective of Trench Crusade is to achieve victory by completing mission-specific goals, which can range from capturing strategic points to annihilating the enemy forces. The game's scenarios often reflect the grim and unpredictable nature of trench warfare, with both strategic planning and adaptability playing crucial roles. 

**Turn Structure**: The game is played in a series of rounds, each consisting of several phases:
