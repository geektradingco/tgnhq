One of the most exciting aspects of **Trench Crusade** is the opportunity to collect, paint, and customize your own miniatures. The game features a wide array of detailed miniatures, each representing the **diverse characters and units** from the game's factions. 

## Types of Miniatures 

**Heaven**: Angelic forces are often depicted with majestic wings, gleaming armor, and divine weapons. These miniatures can range from ethereal seraphim to heavily armored archangels, each exuding a sense of grace and power. 

**Hell**: The demonic legions boast a variety of terrifying and grotesque miniatures. From monstrous demons with twisted forms to infernal sorcerers and corrupted warriors, these figures bring the horrors of Hell to life on your tabletop. 

**Humanity**: Human forces are depicted with a mix of historical and fantastical elements. Soldiers clad in World War I-era uniforms, wielding both conventional and supernatural weaponry, make up the bulk of humanity's forces. Unique characters, such as rogue Templars or occult investigators, add depth and variety. 

## Painting and Customization 

Painting and customizing your miniatures is a great way to add a personal touch to your Trench Crusade army. Here are some tips to get you started: 
- **Priming**: Start by applying a primer to your miniatures. This helps the paint adhere better and provides a smooth base for your colors. 
- **Base Coating**: Apply the base colors to your miniatures. Use thin layers to build up color gradually without obscuring the fine details. 
- **Shading and Highlighting**: Use washes and glazes to add depth to your miniatures. Highlighting raised areas with lighter shades can make details pop. 
- **Detailing**: Focus on the finer details such as eyes, weapons, and armor accents. This step can bring your miniatures to life and add character to each figure. 
- **Basing**: Create custom bases for your miniatures to match the battlefield terrain. This can include adding texture, foliage, or even small dioramas to enhance the visual appeal.
