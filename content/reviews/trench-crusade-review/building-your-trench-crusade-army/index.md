Creating an army in Trench Crusade is a strategic and creative process. Each faction offers a distinct playstyle and unique units, allowing players to **tailor their forces to their preferred tactics and aesthetics**. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you build a formidable army: 

## Choosing a Faction 
- **Heaven**: If you prefer a disciplined, high-morale force with powerful healing and defensive abilities, the angelic hosts of Heaven might be for you. Their units are often highly resilient, with abilities that can turn the tide of battle. 
- **Hell**: For those who enjoy aggressive, fear-inducing tactics and devastating offensive capabilities, the demonic legions of Hell are an excellent choice. Their units are typically fierce and hard-hitting, but may require careful management to avoid their inherent risks. 
- **Humanity**: If you favor versatility and tactical ingenuity, human forces offer a blend of conventional military units and occult specialists. They can adapt to various scenarios, employing both technology and supernatural artifacts to their advantage. 

## Understanding Unit Roles 
Each unit in Trench Crusade has a specific role on the battlefield. Understanding these roles is crucial for building a balanced and effective army: 
- **Infantry**: The backbone of any army, infantry units are versatile and often form the bulk of your forces. They can hold objectives, engage in close combat, and provide ranged support. 
- **Specialists**: These units possess unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle. Examples include healers, spellcasters, and elite warriors. Specialists often have specific roles, such as disrupting enemy plans or supporting friendly units. 
- **Heavy Units**: These powerful units bring considerable firepower and resilience to your army. Examples include heavily armored knights, monstrous demons, and advanced war machines. Heavy units can dominate key areas of the battlefield but may require support from other units. 
- **Support Units**: These units provide buffs, debuffs, or other tactical advantages. Support units can enhance your army's effectiveness by boosting morale, healing wounds, or disrupting enemy formations. 

## Creating Balanced and Effective Armies 
Building a balanced army involves considering the strengths and weaknesses of your chosen faction and units. Here are some tips for creating a well-rounded force: 
- Mix Unit Types: A diverse army with a mix of infantry, specialists, heavy units, and support units is **more versatile and can adapt to different scenarios**. 
- Synergy: **Ensure your units work well together**. For example, pairing healers with front-line fighters can keep your troops in the fight longer. Combining ranged units with melee specialists can create powerful combos. 
- Focus on Objectives: Tailor your army to the objectives of the mission. If capturing points is crucial, include units that excel at holding and defending positions. If annihilation is the goal, prioritize high-damage units. 
- Know Your Enemy: **Adjust your army composition based on your opponent's faction and typical strategies**. If facing a heavily armored opponent, bring units with high armor-piercing capabilities. If facing a fast-moving enemy, include units that can control or slow their advance. 
- Flexibility: Be prepared to **adapt your strategy based on the unfolding battle**. A balanced army can switch roles and adapt to changing circumstances more effectively than a specialized force. 

Building your army is a rewarding aspect of Trench Crusade, allowing you to express your creativity and strategic thinking. With **careful planning and a good understanding of your faction and units**, you'll be well-prepared to lead your forces to victory.
