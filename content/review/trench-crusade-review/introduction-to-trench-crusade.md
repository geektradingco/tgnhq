Imagine a world where the very fabric of history has been torn apart by supernatural forces. This is the premise of **Trench Crusade**, a skirmish-scale tabletop miniatures game that plunges players into a nightmarish alternate timeline. The game's narrative begins during the Crusades, a period already fraught with **intense conflict and religious fervor**. In this altered history, a faction of heretical Templars defied the Almighty, summoning the forces of Hell to the mortal plane. Over 800 years later, in 1914, the relentless war between Heaven and Hell rages on, with **humanity caught in the crossfire**.

**Trench Crusade** distinguishes itself by merging the grim realities of trench warfare with the horrors of supernatural conflict. Players command armies of angelic warriors, demonic entities, and mortal soldiers, each with unique abilities and tactics. The gameâ€™s **dark and immersive setting**, combined with its innovative mechanics, offers a unique and compelling experience for fans of both history and fantasy.

Are you ready to take command and lead your forces to victory in this epic battle for the soul of the world?
