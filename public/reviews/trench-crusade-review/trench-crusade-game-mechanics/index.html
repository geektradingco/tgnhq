  <h1>Trench Crusade Game Background</h1>
  <p><strong>Trench Crusade</strong> combines traditional tabletop wargaming elements with unique supernatural abilities, creating a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core mechanics that drive the game:</p>
<h2 id="core-rules-and-objectives">Core Rules and Objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: The primary objective of Trench Crusade is to achieve victory by completing mission-specific goals, which can range from capturing strategic points to annihilating the enemy forces. The game&rsquo;s scenarios often reflect the grim and unpredictable nature of trench warfare, with both strategic planning and adaptability playing crucial roles.</p>
<p><strong>Turn Structure</strong>: The game is played in a series of rounds, each consisting of several phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiative Phase: Players roll for initiative to determine the order of play.</li>
<li>Movement Phase: Units are moved according to their movement characteristics and terrain considerations.</li>
<li>Shooting Phase: Ranged attacks are resolved, with dice rolls determining hits, wounds, and saves.</li>
<li>Combat Phase: Close combat is resolved, including melee attacks and special abilities.</li>
<li>Morale Phase: Units may need to take morale checks based on casualties suffered.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="movement-combat-and-special-abilities">Movement, Combat, and Special Abilities</h2>
<p><strong>Movement</strong>: Units in Trench Crusade have specific movement stats that dictate how far they can travel each turn. Terrain features such as trenches, barbed wire, and rubble can impact movement, providing both challenges and tactical advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranged Combat: Players resolve ranged attacks by rolling dice to hit, wound, and potentially negate armor saves. Different weapons have varying ranges, rates of fire, and special rules.</li>
<li>Melee Combat: Close-quarters combat is fast and brutal. Units engage in melee using their combat stats and special abilities. Successful hits in melee can bypass certain defenses, making it a deadly aspect of the game.</li>
<li>Special Abilities: Each faction in Trench Crusade has unique special abilities that reflect their supernatural origins and powers. For example:</li>
<li>Heaven: Divine interventions, healing auras, and radiant smites.</li>
<li>Hell: Infernal pacts, demonic strength, and fear-inducing attacks.</li>
<li>Humanity: Tactical ingenuity, mechanical augmentations, and improvised weaponry.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="winning-conditions">Winning Conditions</h2>
<p>Victory in Trench Crusade is determined by achieving the objectives outlined in the chosen scenario. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture and Hold: Controlling key strategic points on the battlefield.</li>
<li>Annihilation: Eliminating the enemy forces.</li>
<li>Survival: Keeping key units alive for a certain number of rounds.</li>
