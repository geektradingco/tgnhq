  <h1>Trench Crusade Game Background</h1>
  <p>The story of Trench Crusade <strong>begins during the medieval Crusades, a time of religious zeal and brutal warfare</strong>. In this alternate timeline, a renegade group of Templars, seeking power beyond mortal comprehension, turned their backs on the Almighty and <strong>performed a forbidden ritual</strong>. This reckless act tore open the fabric of reality, unleashing the forces of Hell upon the Earth. As demonic legions spilled forth, humanity&rsquo;s defenders, the angelic hosts of Heaven, descended to oppose them.</p>
<p><strong>Fast forward to 1914</strong>, the world is now an endless battlefield where the Great War is not just between nations but between Heaven and Hell, with <strong>humanity caught in the middle</strong>. The once serene landscapes are now desolate wastelands, filled with trenches, barbed wire, and the remnants of colossal battles.</p>
<p>Factions:
-<strong>Heaven</strong>: The angelic forces of Heaven are majestic and fearsome, wielding divine powers to combat the infernal hordes. They seek to restore order and vanquish the forces of Hell, striving to save humanity&rsquo;s soul in the process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hell</strong>: The demonic legions of Hell, led by their sinister overlords, seek to spread chaos and corruption. They revel in destruction, aiming to drag the world into eternal damnation.</li>
<li><strong>Humanity</strong>: Caught between these two supernatural forces, humanity fights desperately for survival. Comprising various military factions and resistance groups, human forces use a mix of conventional weaponry and captured supernatural artifacts to hold their ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>The clash of these factions <strong>creates a unique and immersive backdrop for the game</strong>, blending historical elements with dark fantasy. Players can explore this rich lore through their armies and campaigns, each battle adding a new chapter to the epic saga of <strong>Trench Crusade</strong>.</p>
