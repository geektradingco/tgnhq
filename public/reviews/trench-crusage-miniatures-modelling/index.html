  <h1>Trench Crusade Miniatures and Modelling</h1>
  <p>One of the most exciting aspects of <strong>Trench Crusade</strong> is the opportunity to collect, paint, and customize your own miniatures. The game features a wide array of detailed miniatures, each representing the <strong>diverse characters and units</strong> from the game&rsquo;s factions.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-miniatures">Types of Miniatures</h2>
<p><strong>Heaven</strong>: Angelic forces are often depicted with majestic wings, gleaming armor, and divine weapons. These miniatures can range from ethereal seraphim to heavily armored archangels, each exuding a sense of grace and power.</p>
<p><strong>Hell</strong>: The demonic legions boast a variety of terrifying and grotesque miniatures. From monstrous demons with twisted forms to infernal sorcerers and corrupted warriors, these figures bring the horrors of Hell to life on your tabletop.</p>
<p><strong>Humanity</strong>: Human forces are depicted with a mix of historical and fantastical elements. Soldiers clad in World War I-era uniforms, wielding both conventional and supernatural weaponry, make up the bulk of humanity&rsquo;s forces. Unique characters, such as rogue Templars or occult investigators, add depth and variety.</p>
<h2 id="painting-and-customization">Painting and Customization</h2>
<p>Painting and customizing your miniatures is a great way to add a personal touch to your Trench Crusade army. Here are some tips to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Priming</strong>: Start by applying a primer to your miniatures. This helps the paint adhere better and provides a smooth base for your colors.</li>
<li><strong>Base Coating</strong>: Apply the base colors to your miniatures. Use thin layers to build up color gradually without obscuring the fine details.</li>
<li><strong>Shading and Highlighting</strong>: Use washes and glazes to add depth to your miniatures. Highlighting raised areas with lighter shades can make details pop.</li>
<li><strong>Detailing</strong>: Focus on the finer details such as eyes, weapons, and armor accents. This step can bring your miniatures to life and add character to each figure.</li>
<li><strong>Basing</strong>: Create custom bases for your miniatures to match the battlefield terrain. This can include adding texture, foliage, or even small dioramas to enhance the visual appeal.</li>
</ul>
